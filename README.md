# huawei-block-list
## Captured with blockada

I've collected these domains and subdomains by using Blockada for several months & adding each entry manually. These should block all(i hope?) the outgoing connection to huawei servers. I did not used wildcard as its resource intensive. I'll keep updating this list as i discover more domains.
