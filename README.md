# huawei-block-list

## What is this? 
It's a block list. You can integrate this into your PiHole or local blocking software such as Blokada, AdAway... etc. to block out all the outgoing connections to the said domains.

## Why do i need this?
It turns out, if your device has bloated softwares(ie. Apps that comes pre-installed and you can't remove them unless you root your device, you're forced into keeping those services running. Manufacturers like Huawei have stopped providing bootloader unlock codes thereby not allowing you to root your device. So, the best solution is to setup a local proxy server that blocks the connection. 

## Captured with Blockada

I've collected these subdomains by using Blockada for several months & adding each entry manually. These should block all(i hope?) the outgoing connection to huawei servers. I did not used wildcard as its resource intensive. I'll keep updating this list as i discover more domains.

## How to contribute?

If you've got more doamins to add this list, please put up an issue.
